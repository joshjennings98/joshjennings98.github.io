# Josh's Website

This is my website. It is generated from markdown files using clojure.

## Known issues

* Back and forward buttons behave funny with anchors in the page. Is this just a browser problem???
* The `Back to top` button will add an entry to the browser history since it is using the `#` anchor which means the browser sees the scroll to top as a new page being loaded.
