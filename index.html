      <h1>Josh's Website</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class="page" id="this-website">
        <div class="page-header">
          <h2>This Website</h2>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>The goal of this website was to create an interactive static website using on HTML and CSS, no JavaScript. I had recently read <a href="https://briankoberlein.com/tech/quiet-web/">an article about the quiet web</a> which inspired me to try and create an interesting website that satisfied the requirements laid out in the blog post:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul><li> Exclude any page that has ads. 
</li>
<li> Remove them if they use Google Analytics or Google Fonts. 
</li>
<li> Remove them if they use scripts or trackers.

</li></ul>
        <p>These are arbitrary requirements but it seemed like an interesting challenge. On top of this, in the event that CSS was disabled, I also wanted my website to retain most of it's usability.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I am not one for frontend development and none of the previous versions of my site have used a JavaScript framework, however, in a previous iteration of my website I had a script that would allow you to change the theme between light mode and dark mode. I enjoyed this gimicky feature and wanted to keep that functionality.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Re-implementing theme toggle using only CSS</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>The main feature that I wanted to emulate using CSS was a light mode toggle. I wanted to be able to click a button and have the colour scheme change. With JavaScript I would watch for a checkbox and have an <code>onchange</code> event that makes the colour changes. Since this relies on JavaScript, this approach is not possible. So using only CSS we need some way to:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul><li> Know that a checkbox has been checked.
</li>
<li> If the user was previously in a dark mode the page should become light or vice versa. 
</li>
<li> This needs to be dynamic and not just occur on page load but any time a user checks the checkbox.

</li></ul>
        <p>Luckily, CSS has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes">pseudo-classes</a>. These are keywords that are attached to a selector and specify a state of the selected element, for example <code>:hover</code> is triggered when an element is hovered over. There exists the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:checked"><code>:checked</code> pseudo-class</a> which can be used to change the style of a checkbox or radio button based on whether or not it is checked. This satisfies the goal of making the change dynamic and controllable by the user.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>However, there is a problem. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Styling in CSS will only apply to descendants of the the DOM node for the element (if the styling doesn't only affect the specific element i.e. <code>margin</code> will only affect the current element, but <code>font-family</code> will apply to the descendants). In either case, the inheritance only goes down the DOM tree and we cannot affect the properties of any parent elements.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>We can have some degree of control over which descendants are affected by the styling through the use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator">general sibling combinator</a>. This seperates two seletors and matches all instances of the second element that appear anywhere after the first element that share the same parent element. For example, the following would match all span elements that come after the paragraph element in the DOM tree:</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="csscode" title="css">p ~ span {
  color: red;
}
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>From the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator#html">general sibling combinator docs</a> we can see how this would work:</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="htmlcode" title="html">&lt;article&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;This is not red because it appears before any paragraph.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;Here is some code.&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
    This span is red because it appears after the paragraph, even though there
    are other nodes in between
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whatever it may be, keep smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Dream big&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
    Doesn't matter how many or what kind of nodes are in between, all spans from
    the same parent after a paragraph are red.
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;span&gt;
  This span is not red because it doesn't share a parent with a paragraph
&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>How does this help us? Well, since we can style elements based on the pseudo-class selectors, the CSS can be modified to change based on the checked state of a checkbox. Say we have a class for the checkbox called <code>.dark-mode-checkbox</code>, we can do the following and change the font for siblings of an element based on whether the checkbox is checked:</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="csscode" title="css">.content {
  font-family: Serif;
}

.dark-mode-checkbox:checked ~ .container {
  font-family: Monospace;
}
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>And in the HTML do something like this:</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="htmlcode" title="html">&lt;input hidden class="dark-mode-checkbox" id="dark-mode" type="checkbox"&gt;

&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;label class="dark-mode-label" for="dark-mode"&gt;Toggle Dark Mode&lt;/label&gt;
  ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>You can see that the checkbox and the container are siblings. This is important as we wouldn't be able to have the content as a descendant of the checkbox due to the nature of inputs. One strange thing it does mean, is that we have the label for the button not be a parent or sibling of the checkbox. This is not an issue as we use the <code>for</code> attribute.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Now that we have the general technique, we can utilise it for the dark mode.</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="csscode" title="css">:root {
  --c-text: #3c3836;
  --c-background: #fbf1c7;
  --c-dark-text: #ebdbb2;
  --c-dark-background: #282828;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --c-text: #ebdbb2;
    --c-background: #282828;
    --c-dark-text: #3c3836;
    --c-dark-background: #fbf1c7;
  }
}

.dark-mode-checkbox:checked ~ .container {
  --c-text: var(--c-dark-text);
  --c-background: var(--c-dark-background);
}

.container {
  color: var(--c-text);
  background-color: var(--c-background);
}
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>We use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS variables</a> and change them based on whether the checkbox is checked. We can then reference these variables in the CSS (such as when we set the background and text colour) to update the colours accordingly.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>We can also utilise <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme"><code>prefers-color-scheme</code></a> to detect whether the initial colour scheme should be light or dark. Since we can use generic terminalogy in our labels, we can treat the light mode as the dark mode for users who initially requested the dark mode. There is this neat <a href="https://codepen.io/kleinfreund/pen/NmpKZM">codepen demo</a> for determining whether your web browser supports this and what defaults to. This all means that the website will be the correct mode for users and they won't have to click the checkbox to toggle the theme. This ultimately makes the whole approach with the checkbox pointless, but this whole website is an exercise in pointlessness so I am doing it anyway. It also led to some interesting problems that I got to solve, I will go over theses in the next few sections.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>One more problem arises. The checkbox is not part of the content and so it is unaffected by the styling. We cannot make it part of the container because it will never be able to affect the styling of it's parent. Luckily, since the label that you can click doesn't have to be a sibling of the checkbox itself, we can just hide the actual checkbox. Since the label can be clicked and we used the <code>for</code> attribute, it should still be accessible.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Storing theme across pages</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>TODO.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Having usable URLs</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>TODO.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Code Generation</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>I implemented my own static site generator. Since my website is basically a single page application, I only ned to populate the <code>index.html</code> file. I use Go with it's powerful templating to fill the relevant sections of the <code>index.html</code> with content that has been parsed from markdown files. This means that if I want to add a page, I just add a markdown file, and the website will automatically regenerate the <code>index.html</code> when I push the change to GitHub. This is done with a simple CI workflow. GitHub pages then handles the deployment of the actual website, this is discuessed in the section below.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The Go code is not interesting. It is written with only standard library modules. It reads the markdown from the markdown directory, converts it into HTML using regex to convert the various markdown tags into their HTML equivalent, and then populates the templates for the <code>index.html</code> and <code>404.html</code> pages. Since there is only one page to really think about, the code is kept relatively simple.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The index template <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/joshjennings98.github.io/blob/master/templates/index.html.tmpl">can be found here</a>, whilst the Go program for populating the template <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/joshjennings98.github.io/blob/master/main.go">can be found here</a>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The workflow to run the program in CI is very simple. It uses GitHub actions to checkout the repo, and if there are changes to the markdown or templates then it will regenerate the index and commit the changes back to the repository. There is also a similar workflow that is used for generating my CV. In this case, the CV is kept as a <code>yaml</code> file and then a python script is used to turn it into HTML. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The CI workflows <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/joshjennings98.github.io/tree/master/.github/workflows">can be found here</a>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Deployment using GitHub Pages</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>I don't want to spend money so I host the website with GitHub pages. This is particularly nice since I am hosting the repository on GitHub so deployments are trivial.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You can use GitHub pages with fancy <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> setups but that probably involves some JavaScript which I don't want (also I prefer <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> if I use a static site generator that isn't my own). Instead I just use my own static site generator that populates the <code>index.html.template</code> as talked about in the previous section. This makes the deployments very simple as there is only one page, it is as simple as the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">hello world example for github pages</a>. Since this is hosted on GitHub I don't even have to worry about CI for the actual deplyoment as it is handled by GitHub.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Unfortunately I can't have just one page, I need a 404 page so that users can still navigate my website if they go to a wrong page. Again, because this is GitHub pages, this is very simple. You just need to create a <code>404.html</code> and have it at the root of the repo, no need for special files like a <code>.htaccess</code>. You can create a tempalte for the 404 page and populate it like the index so that the website looks consistent and all the links can be accessed easily from the 404 page.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If you want to use a custom domain with GitHub pages, that is also relatively simple, you just need to add a CNAME record to your reopository. This involves two steps:</p>
        <ul><li> Adding a CNAME record file to your repository.
</li>
<li> Creating a CNAME record with your DNS provider.

</li></ul>
        <p>The CNAME record file contains the domain you want to use for your website. A CNAME record is used to specify that a domain name is an alias for another domain. This basically acts as a redirect so a custom dmain name can be used. The target domain must have an A address record. The A adress record is used to map a domain to it's corresponding IP where the werbsite is hosted.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>To create the CNAME record itself, you must go to your DNS provider and create a CNAME record that points the domain to the GitHub pages URL (in my case joshjenning98.github.io). This is a different process for different DNS provders. In my case I used Google domains (for the <code>.dev</code> top level domain) for which the information on setting up a CNAME record can be found <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/47283?hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-get-your-unique-cname-record%2Cstep-add-the-cname-record-to-your-domains-dns-records">on this page</a>. If you want to enforce HTTPS (a requirement for <code>.dev</code>) you must aso go to the GitHub pages setting and have "Enforce HTTPS" enabled.</p>

      <div class="page" id="backend-demo-tool">
        <div class="page-header">
          <h2>Backend Demo Tool</h2>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>This is a small <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/">Flask</a> application that makes it easier to demonstrate backend features.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Frontend developers have a much easier time of it when it comes to demonstrating their work. It is easy to see what they've done and they can make it look as interesting as they want. In comparison, trying to demo a backend API or tool is rarely interesting to watch. It usually involves a lot of text, ends up with the presenter pulling out a terminal to show commands on the fly, searching their command history and hoping they do everything in the right order. All this to get some JSON or similarly uninteresting output.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This project is an attempt to try and improve that situation and make backend demos simpler and more engaging. To do this, a python application was created that reads a simple text file containing information to present and generates a web server with Flask. The data for each slide is exposed as JSON via endpoints and with a simple <code>index.html</code> and some JavaScript, the tool is able to create a simple presentation that is shown in the browser and can be clicked through like a PowerPoint presentation.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The advantage this provides is that python can be to execute pre-written commands and stream the results back to the webserver and expose it via an iframe that is then embedded into a slide. This allows you to easily demonstrate commands without having to open a terminal. It also means you can plan the exact order of the commands and not worry about mixing them up. A side effect of running the presentation in the browser is that you can easily have links that open up in new tabs which can be useful to show the result of any executed commands, this is useful as you can just share the web browser during a meeting instead of having to switch between PowerPoint, a terminal, and a web browser.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This application lends itself to a presentation method similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method">Takahashi method</a> where you have a concise slides with very little text. The created presentations are more complex than the Taskahashi method but it is still purposefully designed to keep things simple by only having one type of content per slide, be that text, a command output, or something else.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The result is that with this application backend demos should be much easier to create and run whilst also being slightly more engaging.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ul><li> A presentation is uses just a simple text file.
</li>
<li> A slide can contain one of: text, an executed command, a code block, or an image and are delimted by the tags: <code>[TEXT]</code>, <code>[COMMAND]</code>, <code>[CODE]</code>, and <code>[IMAGE]</code>.
</li>
<li> Executed commands will stream output to be shown in the slide.
</li>
<li> The command that is executed is shown above the command output.
</li>
<li> Correctly renders commands that span multiple lines.
</li>
<li> Optionally run command every few seconds like <code>watch</code>.
</li>
<li> Code blocks are automatically highlighted using <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">hightlight.js</a>.
</li>
<li> Text slides will add text line by line like a PowerPoint presentation with animations.
</li>
<li> Left click or right arrow to go forwards, right click or left arrow to go backwards.
</li>
<li> When going backwards previously rendered text is handled properly and slides don't reset.
</li>
<li> Extremely easy to use and share via screen sharing.
</li>
<li> Configurable CSS if you desire to change the look.
</li>
<li> Jump to any slide via a drop down menu.

</li></ul>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>The tool is not on PyPi so to install it you will need to <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/backend-demo">clone the repository</a>. Once this is done <code>cd</code> into the base directory and run <code>pip install .</code> to install it as <code>backend_demo</code>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>To create a presentation you just need to write a command file <code>commands.txt</code> like this:</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="code" title="">[TEXT] 
This is a slide

[COMMAND] 
ping -c 4 google.com

[TEXT] 
I am another text slide
with multiple lines

[IMAGE]
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/73/Hyperion_cover.jpg

[CODE]
def main():
    print("I am a code block")
    print("I will be automatically syntax highlighted with hightlight.js")

[COMMAND]
echo commands \
spanning \
multiple \
lines \
are \
handled
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>To present a presentation, pass the command file as an argument to <code>backend_demo</code>:</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="code" title="">backend_demo commands.txt
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p><i>Currently, all the commands are run in a sub shell on you machine so be careful with what you execute.</i></p>

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Forward Propagation</h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>A single forward propagation though a layer just involves multiplying the inputs to the layer with the layer weights (their dot product). After this, they are summed and the bias added before having the activation layer for that function applied.</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="fsharpcode" title="fsharp">let forwardSingleLayer (bias : float) (weights : float list list) (inputs : float list) (activation : Activation) : float list =
    weights
    |&gt; List.map (fun list -&gt; List.map2 ( * ) list inputs)
    |&gt; List.map (fun list -&gt; List.sum list + bias)
    |&gt; activateLayer activation
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>The activateLayer function takes an activation and maps the corresponding activation function across the list before returning it. A small part of this function can be see below:</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="fsharpcode" title="fsharp">let activateLayer (activation : Activation) (input : float list) : float list =
    match activation with
    | Sigmoid -&gt;
        List.map (fun x -&gt; 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(-x))) input
    | Relu -&gt;
        List.map (fun x -&gt; max x 0.0) input
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>The full forward propagation is slightly more complex. It first creates an empty list the size of the network. It folds though the epty list using the accumulator to store the intermediate activated and unactivated output of all layers. It then adds an extra layer containing only 1.0s to the end of the forward propagated output. This makes it easier when doing back propagation.</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="fsharpcode" title="fsharp">let forwardFull (parameters : Parameters) (inputs : float list) (layers : Layer list) : float list list =
    List.init layers.Length id
    |&gt; List.fold (fun (acc : float list list) index -&gt;
        let biases, weights, activation =
            parameters.biases.[index], parameters.weights.[index], layers.[index].activation
        [forwardSingleLayer biases weights acc.[0] activation] @ acc)
            [inputs]
    |&gt; List.append [List.init (List.last layers).outputDims float]
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Calculating Error</h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>To calculate the error in the output, the output of forward propagation and the target output are passed to a function that calculated the loss.</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="fsharpcode" title="fsharp">let getOverallError (targetOutputs : float list) (actualOutputs : float list) (loss : Loss) : float =
    actualOutputs
    |&gt; List.map2 (lossFunction loss targetOutputs.Length) targetOutputs
    |&gt; List.sum
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>Similarly to the activation functions, the loss functions are supplied using pattern matching In this case however, they return a function that can be applied wherever the particular value required instead of taking an returning a list. Part of lossFunction can be seen below:</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="fsharpcode" title="fsharp">let lossFunction (loss : Loss) (n : int) : float -&gt; float -&gt; float =
    match loss with
    | MSE -&gt;
        fun actual target -&gt;
            (1.0 / (n |&gt; float)) * (actual - target) ** 2.0
    | MAE -&gt;
        fun actual target -&gt;
            (1.0 / (n |&gt; float)) * (abs (actual - target))
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Back Propagation</h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>Back propagation is more complex than the forward version. We first calculate the intermidate output sums. For the output layer, the only thing that needs to be done is for the derivatve of the loss function to applied to the outputs. For the hidden layers, the individual deltas for each node in the previous layer are found. Afterwards, the layer weights are taken and multiplied by their corresponding deltas. The values coming into each node are then summed.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The new weights are then calculated. This is simpler. The derivative of the activation function is found and then multiplied by the corresponding output delta sum. This is then multipliued by the output od of the previous layer resulting in a value corresponding to <code>learningRate * delta * outPrev</code>. This value is then subtracted from the corresponding weight as back propagation is defined.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The new weights and intermediate output deltas are then returned.</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="fsharpcode" title="fsharp">let backPropSingleLayer (targetOutputs : float list) (loss : Loss) (learningRate : float) (backPropPart : float list) (layerIndex : int) (forwardPropParts : float list list) (allWeights : float list list list) (layers : Layer list) : float list list * float list =

    let intermediateOutputDeltaSum =
        if layerIndex = 0
        then (* Output layer *)
            forwardPropParts.[layerIndex + 1]
            |&gt; List.map2 (dLossFunction loss targetOutputs.Length) backPropPart
        else (* Hidden layers *)
            List.init forwardPropParts.[layerIndex + 1].Length (fun _ -&gt;
                forwardPropParts.[layerIndex]
                |&gt; dActivateLayer layers.[layerIndex - 1].activation
                |&gt; List.map2 ( * ) backPropPart)
            |&gt; List.mapi (fun index1 deltas -&gt;
                allWeights.[layerIndex]
                |&gt; List.mapi (fun index2 weights -&gt; weights.[index1] * deltas.[index2]))
            |&gt; List.map List.sum

    let newWeights =
        forwardPropParts.[layerIndex + 1]
        |&gt; dActivateLayer layers.[layerIndex].activation
        |&gt; List.map2 ( * ) intermediateOutputDeltaSum
        |&gt; List.map (fun delta -&gt;
            forwardPropParts.[layerIndex + 2]
            |&gt; List.map (fun out -&gt; learningRate * delta * out))
        |&gt; List.map2 (List.map2 (-)) allWeights.[layerIndex + 1]

    newWeights, intermediateOutputDeltaSum
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>The full back propagation invloved first reversing the parameters. This makes it easier to work on as we start from the final layer and work towards the input.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The next step is to fold through the network from the outer layer and calculate all the new values for each weight using <code>backPropSingleLayer</code>. This is then added to a list containing each layer and acts as the accumulator.</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="fsharpcode" title="fsharp">let backPropFull (layers : Layer list) (parameters : Parameters) (targetOutputs : float list list) (learningRate : float) (loss : Loss) (forwardPropParts : float list list) : (float list list * float list) list =

    let weights =
        List.rev parameters.weights

    List.init (layers.Length) id
    |&gt; List.fold (fun acc index -&gt;
        let targetOutputs =
            acc.[0]
            |&gt; fst
            |&gt; List.map List.sum

        let backPropPart = snd acc.[0]

        let backPropOutput =

        [backPropOutput] @ acc)
            [targetOutputs, (List.concat targetOutputs)]
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>The derivatives of the activations and loss functions are very similar to the normal counter parts. Parts of the <code>dActivateLayer</code> and <code>dLossFunction</code> can be seen below:</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="fsharpcode" title="fsharp">let dActivateLayer (activation : Activation) (input : float list) : float list =
    match activation with
    | Sigmoid -&gt;
        List.map (fun x -&gt; x * (1.0 - x)) input
    | Relu -&gt;
        List.map (fun x -&gt; if x &gt; 0.0 then 1.0 else 0.0) input

let dLossFunction (loss : Loss) (n : int) : float -&gt; float -&gt; float =
    match loss with
    | MSE -&gt;
    fun actual target -&gt;
    (2.0 / (n |&gt; float)) * (actual - target) * -1.0
    | MAE -&gt;
    fun target actual -&gt;
        if actual &gt; target then 1.0 else -1.0
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Training</h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>Training the network is a fairly simple recursive function that continually picks a random sample of the data set and carries out forwards and backwards propagation using the sample for any number of iterations. A simplified version of the function (initialisation and printing etc. removed) can be seen below:</p>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="fsharpcode" title="fsharp">let rec train (parameters : Parameters) (model : Layer list) (maxIterations : int) (iterations : int) =
    let idx = System.Random().Next(0, List.length targetOutputs)

    let fullSingle =
        forwardFull parameters inputs.[idx] architecture
        |&gt; backPropFull architecture parameters targets.[idx] learningRate loss
        |&gt; weightUpdate parameters

    train fullSingle model maxIterations (iterations + 1)

(* This is called like below *)
train initial architecture iterations 0

        <h3>Bugs</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>Be careful with the chosen parameters. The networks can die easily if the chosen parameters cause weigths to overflow and become NaN, alternatively the network won’t learn the data set correctly.</p>
