    "description": "Worked with the Digital Learning Hub at Imperial College London to develop interactive visualisations for the upcoming online masters course in Machine London that is currently being devloped by Imperial College London. This mainly involved Javascript development and backend web devlopment. I used javascript to create useful visualisations that could improve understanding of complex mathematical ideas such as the effects of different types of regularisation techniques or how different machine learning algorithms work."
