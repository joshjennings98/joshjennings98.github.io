  "aboutMe": "My name is Josh Jennings and I am a 3rd year student at Imperial College London studying for an MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. My main interestes are in software engineering and embedded systems. My favourite programming language is F# but I am also experienced in C++, JavaScript, Python, and ARM Assembly. After my degree I hope to find a job where I can further develop my programming skills and work on interesting projects where the work that I do will be used commercial or industrial environments. An area of industry that I am particularly interested in is robotics or mechatronics. In my free time I enjoy writing and cycling as well as pursuing my own small programming projects, some of which can be seen on the projects page of this website.",
