<!-- title: SensUS 2018 Vancomycin Biosenser Application -->
<div style="height: 60vh;">
    <p>
        Developed an Android application for smartphones that can find and extract the intensity of a coloured line from an image and assign to it a concentration. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The application was used in conjunction with lateral flow assay membranes designed by chemistry students to detect Vancomycin concentrations in blood plasma. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This was achieved by taking real timeimages from the phoneâ€™s camera and feeding a histogram based on the colour and intensity into a neural network trained to assign a concentration value to the input.

        Won third place for innovation out of the thirteen universities competing in <a href="https://www.sensus.org/event">SensUs 2018</a>.
