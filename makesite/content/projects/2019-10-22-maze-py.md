        This is a simple program that generates and prints a maze in the terminal that has been generated using Kruskal's Algorithm.

        It they uses a naive maze solver based on a depth first search to solve the maze. It differs from a depth first search in that if it is next to the exit in any direction, it will go to the exit even if thats's not what would usually happen in a depth first search.
