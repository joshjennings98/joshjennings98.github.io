            Introduction to Support Vector Machines
        </h1>
        <p>
            Support Vector Machines are statistical methods of classifying data.
        </p>
        <h4>
            What is Classification
        </h4>
        <p>
            Many problems in machine learning involve classification. 
            This is where we have a data set that is split into different categories based on various characteristics and we want to add a new data point to the set and put it into the correct category.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if we are an engineering department at a university, we might have data that sows that new students to the university are accepted if they have good grades in both Physics and Maths. 
            The engineering department could represent this data using a 2D plot of Maths exam results against Physics exam results, and using then if they asked a student for their physics and maths exam results, they could add the results to the graph and see if the student should be accepted.
            Classification is used to determine whether the new point is in the accepted category or the rejected category.
        </p>
        <p>
            <div align="center">
                <div id = 'mathsandphysics'></div>
            </div>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There are many approaches to classification, but one of the simplest ways is to draw a straight line that separates the different catagories, and then assigning any new data points the category based on which side of the line they are on.
            This raises more problems though. As can be seen below, there are many lines that can separate the two categories. 
            How do we know that the line we have chosen is most likely to classify new datapoints correctly?
        </p>
        <p>
            <div align="center">
                <div id = 'separatinglines'></div>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            What we need is an algorithm that take all the data points we currently have and outputs the line that is most likely to correctly classify new data. 
        </p>
        <h4>
            Good and Bad Classifiers
        </h4>
        <p>
            In the example above, all the lines split the data correctly so how can we know which was best?
            A good classifier not only has to be good at separating the data we already have, it also has classify data that hasn't been seen yet. 
            We use the data we already have to get a general idea of what future data might look like.
        </p>
        <p>
            <div align="center">
                <div id = 'linearlyseparable'></div>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the example above, the first plots line separates the data, but it gets very close to both clusters.
            This isn't ideal since if we add a red point thats close to the red cluster, there is a large chance that it is classified as blue since it will be on the other side of the line.
        </p>
        <p> 
            In the second plot, the the line perfectly separates the data but is also very far away from both clusters. 
            This means that new points are unlikely to be misclassified.
        </p>
        <h4>
            How do we get a good classifier?
        </h4>
        <p>
            In order to get a classifier like the one in the second plot, we can use <b>Support Vector Machines</b>. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning model that is very good at coming up with optimal classifiers.

                </form>
            </div>
        </p>
