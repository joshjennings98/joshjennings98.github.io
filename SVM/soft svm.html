            Soft Margin Support Vector Machines
        </h1>
        <p>
            If our data is not completely linearly separable due to a few points, depsite still looking like a linear classifer would generally do a good job, we can use <b>Soft Margin SVMs</b>.
            <br> These are a type of Support Vector Machine that allows for a certain amount of error during training.
            The amount of error is known as <b><i>C</i></b> or the <b>Hinge Loss</b>.
            The use of this parameter is a tradeoff between having a large margin and correctly classifying the training data.
            You get better classification of training data at the expense of a wide margin.
            By choosing a higher value of <i>C</i> you imply that you want less errors on the training data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The choice of <i>C</i> can be a complicated task in istelf and sometimes requires complex algorithms to decide it.
            Have a look at the plot below to see how adjusting the size of <i>C</i> affects the margin width.

            Compared to the hard margin SVM, it's not possible anymore to have both a good separating boundary as well as a large point-free margin. 
            This means that some points creep into the margin.

            What About Completely Non-Linearly Separable Data?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Sometimes data is completely non-linearly separable. 
            We aren't always as lucky as we are when we have only a few overlaps of data.
            <br>However, all is not lost. Support Vector Machines can deal with non linearly separable data too using a nifty trick!
