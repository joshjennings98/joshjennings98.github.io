# About Me

My name is Josh Jennings and I'm a backend software engineer at Arm. I work in the Online Tools Group where I help develop and maintain [keil.arm.com](https://www.keil.arm.com/) as well as the backend services that power the [Keil Studio Cloud](https://studio.keil.arm.com/) online IDE for embedded developers. My areas of expertise are in backend web development using Go and Python as well as the use of Kubernetes in orchestrating scalable cloud services.

This website is where I document my (mostly dumb) projects. It was made with no JavaScript, only HTML and CSS (you can read more about that [here](#website)). You can toggle the theme between dark and light using the button at the top of the page. This website is also single page, elements are hidden based on CSS rules. You can view the other pages at the links at the top. Writeups of some of my projects can be found on [the projects page](#projects) and you can read my various blog posts on [my blog](#blog).
