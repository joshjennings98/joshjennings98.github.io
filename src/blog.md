## Blog

This page contains blog posts I have written. There is a mixture of posts about programming (and programming adjacent) stuff and maybe some dev logs.

* [How I made this website with no JavaScript](#website)
* [Understanding neural networks using F#](#fsharp-neural-network)

I also have a couple of project showcases:

* [**Backend Demo Tool:**](#backend-demos)
  - A presentation tool to help with running backend demos.
  - Written in Go using HTMX and websockets.
  
More projects can be found on my [Github page](https://github.com/joshjennings98).
