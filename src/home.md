## About Me

I work in the Online Tools Group where I help develop and maintain the backend services that power the [Keil Studio Cloud](https://studio.keil.arm.com/) online IDE for embedded developers and [keil.arm.com](https://www.keil.arm.com). My areas of expertise are in backend web development using Go and Python as well as the use of Kubernetes in orchestrating scalable cloud services.
