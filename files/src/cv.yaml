    Imperial College London:
      description: MEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering
      location: Oct. 2016 - Jul. 2020
      content:
        - <b>Degree Result:</b> Upper Second Class Honours (2:1)
        - "<b>A Levels:</b> Mathematics (A*), Further Mathematics (A), Physics (A)<span style='display:inline-block; width: 3em;'></span><b>GCSEs:</b> 10 Grade A* to C, including 4 A*"
  Professional Experience:
    Software Engineer:
      description: Development Solutions Group -- Arm ltd.
      location: Nov 2020 - Present
      content:
        - ∙ Worked as a backend developer in the online tools group utilising Golang to implement the asynchronous incremental build system for Keil Studio Cloud online compiler so projects would only upload the necessary files to be recompiled.
        - ∙ Worked on a RESTful API that made it simpler for Keil Studio Cloud to deploy and keep track of new builders and jobs. Used Docker to deploy builders and an ORM database library to keep track of messages and jobs in an efficient way.
        - ∙ Worked on the Jenkins CI for the Arm Compiler teams, migrating pipelines to use docker and conan. Worked on a plugin that allowed developers to copy a command from the dashboard to reproduce any of the tests simplifying their debugging.
        - ∙ Ran sprint retrospectives and hosted daily sync-ups with my team. Also took part in engineering efficiency meetings.
        - ∙ Regularly contributed to code reviews and provided help with onboarding to new team members. Made sure documentation was up to date and wrote setup guides on Confluence. Ran talks on how to use newly developed tools.
    Student Shapers Developer:
      description: Digital Learning Hub/Department of Chemistry -- Imperial College London
      location: Jul 2018 - Sep 2019
      content:
        - "∙ Worked in conjunction with the Digital Learning Hub at Imperial College to create interactive tutorials on several different machine learning topics to be used in conjunction with Imperial College’s online Machine Learning Masters Degree Course."
        - ∙ Produced fully featured web applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, utilising Git for version control as well as python based build automation for the deployment of the web applications.
        - ∙ Worked for the Department of Chemistry in an interdisciplinary team consisting of engineers and chemists to develop a smartphone based biosensor for use with Lateral Flow Assays that could detect Vancomycin concentration in blood plasma using OpenCV and a convolutional neural network by converting colour intensity into a concentration value.
        - ∙ Negotiated for funding, went to an international competition, pitched the app to professionals, and ran a public panel.

  Projects:
    Spiking Neural Network Simulator for Event-Driven Hardware:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/fyp">github</a>)
      content:
        - Used C++ and Python to develop a simulator for generating and testing new spiking neural network models on the Cambridge Computer Laboratory’s Partially-Ordered Event-Triggered System. Designed better algorithms that increased simulation efficiency and improved the current implementations. Provided tooling for researchers wanting to develop new network models. Investigated whether POETS provided performance gains over conventional architectures.
    Discord Bot:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/discord-bot">github</a>)
      content:
        - Made a discord bot that can tell users when the next birthday is, the birthday for a given user, as well as wishing users happy birthday. Utilised MongoDB to host a database per server, can run concurrently on multiple servers in different timezones. Uses GitHub Actions to automatically rebuild, test, and deploy the bot to Heroku when changes are pushed.
    F# Neural Network Library:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/fsharp-neural-network">github</a> and a writeup on my <a href="https://joshj.dev/pages/fsharp-neural-network.html">website</a>)
      content:
        - Developed a small library for creating neural networks designed for and built with F#. The library allows for the creation of neural networks of any size with a large selection of activation functions, optimisers, loss functions, and initialisers.
    Game Boy Emulator:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/game-boy-cpp">github</a>)
      content:
        - Utilised C++ and the SDL2 library to create a Game Boy emulator.
    Static Site Generator:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/joshjennings98.github.io">github</a> and a writeup on my <a href="https://joshj.dev/pages/website.html">website</a>)
      content:
        - Built a custom static site generator for my website written in python that converts markdown into HTML using pandoc and Jinja templates. It uses GitHub Actions to automatically rebuild the site only if the markdown files or templates change.
    Intermittent Claudication Health App:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/Intermittent-Claudication-Health-App">github</a>)
      content:
        - Created a cross-platform smartphone app using JavaScript with the goal to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from Intermittent Claudication. Leveraged React Native and Firebase to create a platform that allows patients to exercise together countering the effects of Intermittent Claudication. The patient’s progress can be monitored remotely by a health practitioner. Developed as part of a team utilising iterative development techniques as well as making sure we regularly peer reviewed each others code. The project won a prize for the best 3rd year group project.
