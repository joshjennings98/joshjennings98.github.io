      location: Oct. 2016 - Jul. 2020
      content:
        - "<b>Degree Result:</b> Upper Second Class Honours (2:1)<span style='display:inline-block; width: 2.75em;'></span><b>A Levels:</b> Mathematics (A*), Further Mathematics (A), Physics (A)"
  Professional Experience:
    Software Engineer:
      description: Online Tools Group — Arm ltd.
      location: Dec 2021 - Present
      content:
        - Used Golang, Docker, and Kubernetes (with custom resources/operators) to deploy new services for Keil Studio's Cloud IDE.
        - Created an asynchronous HTTP file transfer system using Golang to allow Keil Studio to incrementally compile projects.
        - Updated cleanup and deployment cron jobs using Golang and RabbitMQ, decreasing runtime and container storage needs.
        - Worked on a REST API using Golang with OpenAPI that utilised ORM databases to monitor/deploy Keil Studio instances.
        - Developed Python tools to benchmark performance solutions for CircleCI workflows including deployment of Keil Studio.
        - Ran sprint retrospectives and hosted daily sync-ups with my team as well as taking part in engineering efficiency meetings.
        - Regularly took part in code reviews. Provided onboarding to new team members. Wrote documentation and setup guides.
    Graduate Software Engineer:
      description: Development Solutions Group — Arm ltd.
      location: Nov 2020 - Dec 2021
      content:
        - Created a Python tool for Arm Compiler that can replicate any test running in CI locally, vastly reducing debug time.
        - Rewrote Jenkins pipelines to use Docker and Conan for Arm Compiler and led migration of SVN repositories to Gerrit.
        - Developed a guide/testbench for the Generic Interrupt Controller making it easier for other Fast Models developers to use.
    Student Developer:
      description: Digital Learning Hub/Department of Chemistry — Imperial College London
      location: Jul 2018 - Sep 2019
      content:
        - Created interactive tutorials on machine learning topics for Imperial College's online Machine Learning Masters Degree.
        - Produced interactive web apps using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Used Python/Flask for build automation and deployment.
        - Built a smartphone-based biosensor that used OpenCV and Lateral Flow Assays to calculate Vancomycin levels in blood.
        - Negotiated for funding, took part in an international competition, pitched the app to professionals, and ran a public panel.

  Projects:
    Spiking Neural Network Simulator for Event-Driven Hardware:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/fyp">github</a>)
      content:
        - Built a spiking neural network simulator for Cambridge Computer Laboratory's Partially-Ordered Event-Triggered System. 
        - Used C++ and Python to design algorithms that increased simulation efficiency and improved the current implementations. 
        - Provided tools for researchers and investigated whether there were performance gains over conventional architectures.
    Discord Bot:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/discord-bot">github</a>)
      content:
        - Created a discord bot in Golang that can provide users birthday information and wish happy birthday on a per-server basis. 
        - Utilised MongoDB to host the birthday database. The bot can run concurrently on multiple servers in different timezones. 
        - Uses GitHub Actions to automatically rebuild and deploy the bot to Heroku when changes are pushed.
    F# Neural Network Library:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/fsharp-neural-network">github</a> and a writeup on my <a href="https://joshj.dev/pages/fsharp-neural-network.html">website</a>)
      content:
        - Developed a small library for creating neural networks designed for and built with F#. 
        - The library supports neural networks of any size with many activation functions, optimisers, loss functions, and initialisers.
    Game Boy Emulator:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/game-boy-cpp">github</a>)
      content:
        - Utilised C++ and the SDL2 library to build a Game Boy emulator.
    Static Site Generator:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/joshjennings98.github.io">github</a> and a writeup on my <a href="https://joshj.dev/pages/website.html">website</a>)
      content:
        - Built a static website generator using python that converts markdown into HTML using pandoc and Jinja templates. 
        - Utilises GitHub Actions to automatically rebuild the site only if the markdown files or templates change.
    Intermittent Claudication Health App:
      description: (See project on <a href="https://github.com/joshjennings98/Intermittent-Claudication-Health-App">github</a>)
      content:
        - Built a cross-platform smartphone app that improves quality of life for patients suffering from Intermittent Claudication. 
        - Leveraged JavaScript, React Native, and Firebase to create a platform that allows patients to exercise together and keep track of the illness. A patient's progress can be monitored remotely by a health practitioner using a web interface. 
        - The application won the prize for the best 3rd year group project.
